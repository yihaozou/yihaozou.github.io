列日之战后，德军在东线也取得了一系列的胜利。得益于大胆的计划和果决的行动，在俄军数量远远超过德奥联军情况下，胜利的天平最终还是偏向了我们。这场战争对指挥官和士兵而言都是个巨大的挑战，但是他们的卓越表现最终获得了回报，战争的成果也足以名列军史。1916年8月19日以后，冯.兴登堡元帅和我又发起了一系列的攻势，战争的残酷程度远超以往。由于德国正在同整个世界作战，兵力和盟友又处于弱势，我们做出了很多艰难的决定，按照当时的情境和我们的信念，这些决定是站得住脚的。战斗方式与过往的战争并无区别，只是军队数量和装备性能提升了。真正值得一提的是战争的规模和范围，整个国家的人口正在使用全部的资源来支撑他们的军队作战。这种场面仅仅在普法战争（1870－1871）期间的法国曾出现过。在战争中，军队和平民就是一个整体，根本没法割裂开来。也正因为如此，关于这场战争的定义在字面上无限扩展，成为了世界大战。彼时彼刻，世界上最强大的国家们注意力高度集中，军队在漫长的边境和广袤的海洋厮杀，平民间道德和舆论力量也在不断攻击和分化。如果拥有足够数量的军队的话，发动和赢得战争并不困难。但是在战争的头三年里，元帅和我从未如此幸运。在已有的条件下，我们竭尽所能，凭借信念和经验，去争取战争的胜利，我们的努力最终也获得了胜利女神的青睐（指东线战事结束）。1918年3月份，我们集中了优势兵力发起进攻（西线），胜利指日可待。但不幸的是，敌人的力量也变得更加强大，最终我们的希望都化成了泡影。第一次世界大战给德国造成了巨大的压力，如果我们要赢得胜利，每个公民都必须做到极致，为工作和战斗流尽最后一滴血汗。同时又需要对胜利抱有信心，这很困难却又是必要的。就像橡树离不开土壤一样，我们的陆军和海军也需要祖国的支持，来获取力量和勇气。对于军需物资，盟友和占领地能够提供一部分，而更关键的士气和情感支持，却必须由国内来提供。有了这些，士兵们才能前赴后继、奋力拼杀。如果得不到补充，我们的处境就很危险了。随着战争持续的时间越来越长，士气和物资的补充变得越发困难，军队面临的形势也会更加严峻。

英文原文： The coup de main at Liege was the first of the series of German victories. The decision was a bold one, and its execution extremely daring. The campaigns of 1914, 1915 and the summer of 1916 in the East were tremendous achievements, equal to the greatest military feats of any age. They made the highest demands on both commanders and troops. The Russians were then greatly superior in numbers to the allied German and Austro-Hungarian armies opposed to them. But, indeed, the operations which Field-Marshal von Hindenburg and I had to conduct from the 19th August, 1916, the day we assumed supreme command, rand among the most formidable in history. Nothing more awe-inspiring and destructive has ever been seen on earth. Germany, inferior in numbers and with weak allies, was contending against the world. Decisions of the utmost gravity had to be taken. They were the inevitable and logical results of the situation, our general conception of war, and the particular circumstance of this war. The armies and fleets fought as they had fought in days past, even though numbers and equipment were mightier than ever before. What made this war different from all others was the manner in which the home population supported and reinforced their armed forces with all the resources at thier disposal. Only in France, in 1870-71, had anything of the kind been seen before. In this war it was impossible to distinguish where sphere of the Army and Navy began and that of the people ended. Army and people were one. The world witnessed the war of Nations in the most literal sense of the word. In this mighty concentration of effort the Great Powers of the earth faced each other. And not only between the armed forces did the combat rage along those huge fronts and on distant oceans. The moral and vital force of the civil population was assailed with the purpose of corroding and paralysing them. With big battalions it is neither difficult nor very risky to wage war and fight battles. But in the first three years of the war the Field-Marshal and I never found ourselves in that enviable position. We could but act as duty and conscience dictated, and adopt the measures we deemed necessary to secure victory. During this period success crowned our efforts. When, in March, 1918, we attacked with the balance of numbers more in our facour than had previously been the case, our strength sufficed to win great victories, but not to bring about a rapid decision. Then it dwindled, while the enemy grew stronger. II The world-wide war of nations made enormous demands on us Germans, on whom its whole overwhelming burden fell. Every individual had to give his very utmost, if we were to win. We had literally to fight and work to the last drop of blood and sweat, and yet maintain our fighting spirit and, above all, our confidence in victory: a hard but imperative necessity, in spite of the dearth of food which the enemy imposed on us, and the onslaught of his propaganda, which was of amazing force, if unobtrusive. Our Army and Navy are rooted in the Nation, as is the oak in German soil. They live upon the homeland, and from it they draw their strength. They can keep, but cannot produce, what they need, and can only fight with the moral, material and physical means which the country provides. These means make possible victory, faithful devotion and unselfish self-sacrifice in the daily battle and the miseries of war. They alone could secure Germany's final success. With them our country waged the titanic conflict against the world, even allowing for the assistance of our Allies and the exploitation of occupied territories as far as the laws of land warfare permitted. They Army and Navy had thus to look to the homeland for their constant renewal and rejuvenation in moral, numbers and equipment. It was essential to maintain the moral and war spirit of those at home at highest pitch. Woe to us if they should fail! The longer the war lasted, the greater grew the danger of this, the harder it became to overcome difficulties, and the more imperious were the demands of the Army and Navy for spiritual and moral reinforcement.
